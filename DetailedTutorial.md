# GoalTracker
Final Project Mobile

The frontend alone is in the main branch

Frontend + backend are together in the backend branch. The database exported from phpmyadmin is inside the GoalTrackerPHP file with the backend.

To run the app:

1.Download the files in the main branch as the frontend folder. 
2.Navigate to folder and run it using the command ionic serve -l (for ionic lab).
3.Download the GoalTrackerPHP folder (from the backend branch) and save that file in the htdocs of the Mamp(or Xamp) folder.
